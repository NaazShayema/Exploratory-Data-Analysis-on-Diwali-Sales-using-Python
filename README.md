# 🛍️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Diwali Sales using Python
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal is to uncover useful business insights from the dataset to help target the right audience and boost sales during the festive season.

📁 Dataset
- File Name: Diwali Sales Data.csv

- Source: Provided for learning and analysis purposes.

- Features Include: Customer demographics (Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, etc.), Product information (Category, ID), Purchase details (Amount, Orders), and more.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3

- Libraries: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization, numpy for numerical operations

- Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning

- Removed null and irrelevant columns (Status, unnamed1)

- Dropped rows with missing values

- Converted data types for appropriate columns

2. Data Transformation

- Renamed columns for better readability

- Grouped data to analyze totals by demographic and categorical variables

3. Data Visualization

- Used bar plots and count plots to visualize:

- Gender-wise distribution & purchasing power

- Age group preferences

- Top contributing states

- Impact of marital status on sales

- Occupation-wise purchasing trends

- Top-selling product categories and products

📌 Findings
- Females have a slightly higher purchasing power than males.

- Age group 26–35 years contributes the most to Diwali purchases.

- Majority of buyers are married women.

- Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are the top 3 states in sales.

- People working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors shop the most.

- Most sold products belong to Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

🧠 Conclusion

Married women aged 26–35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare, or Aviation are most likely to buy products during Diwali, especially in Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

These insights can help businesses create targeted marketing campaigns and optimize product offerings during the festive season.
